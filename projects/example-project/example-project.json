  "shortDescription": "The leading DEX and DeFi gateway on Moonbeam",
  "description": "example-project is one of the first automated market-making (AMM), decentralized exchange (DEX) for the Moonbeam parachain network. The unique value proposition of example-project is that we're committed in establishing a strong foundation with our native token, STELLA, as a governance token, diverse farms, a built in bridge and user-centered service. \r\n\r\nexample-project's main objective is to create a broader range of network effects to address the issues of liquidity in the DeFi space, instead of limiting ourselves to a single solution like many DEXs are doing now. This manifests itself in the diverse product suite of example-project that will be explained in more details. Our products are structured in such a way that facilitates decentralized governance of STELLA holders, while continuing to innovate on the collective foundations by design.",
